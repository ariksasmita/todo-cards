# To-do Cards

Simple to-do app created with React, as usual, in my attempt to explore the library. Some features:

 - Items grouped by cards
 - Search items (case sensitive)
 - Filter by finished state
 - [**Local Storage API**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage). Items you made will be kept in browser. Try a refresh ;)
 - [**CSS-in-JS**](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#what-is-css-in-js). Neat way to style small simple app.

Libraries used:
- **Facebook's Create React App** (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- **Material UI** (https://material-ui.com/)
- **Material Design for color and icons** (https://material.io)
